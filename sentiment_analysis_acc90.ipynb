    "- One is to set a hard cut off on the number words in our vocabulary. In class, we only kept the top 3000 frequent words in the vocabulary. \n",
    "- The other way is to use a pretrained word embeddings. This is based on transfer learning, where we reduce the dimensions by learning the relation between words from another training task (e.g.: Word2Vec). \n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the pro and cons for both methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "- One defact about the first approach is that it didn't make use of the labels, i.e.: the dimensionality reduction was applied solely on information about the text. \"Top words are more useful\" is nothing more than one of our hypothesis. We have no idea on what words are more useful when doing classification.\n",
    "- The second approach is better. But one potential problem is that we kept it fixed, meaning that it may not fit in to our problem very well. One solution is to re-train the word embedding together with the weights of the network (simply set `trainable=True`). The training may take a long time thus a GPU is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
